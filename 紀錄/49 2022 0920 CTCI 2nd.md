## **Technical Questions (+ 5 Algorithm Approaches)** 
This section covers how to prepare for technical questions (without wasting your time) and teaches actionable ways to solve the trickiest algorithm problems. It also teaches you what exactly "good coding" is when it comes to an interview.

* How to Prepare 
* What You Need To Know 
* Walking Through a Problem
* Optimize & Solve Technique #1: Look for BUD 
* Optimize & Solve Technique #2: DIY (Do It Yourself) 
* Optimize & Solve Technique #3: Simplify and Generalize 
* Optimize & Solve Technique #4: Base Case and Build 
* Optimize & Solve Technique #5: Data Structure Brainstorm 
* Best Conceivable Runtime (BCR)
* Handling Incorrect Answers
* When You’ve Heard a Question Before 
* The “Perfect” Language for Interviews 
* What Good Coding Looks Like
* Don’t Give Up!**

2 sums 
In a array return the indexes, which sum is T
Z, not sorted, no duplicate, only 1, if no then empty/null

1. Listen
    1. N or Z, Sorted or not, duplicate, only 1 answer

2. [n,n,n,], 0
3. 兩兩排列組合，交換率減少重複
4. 當前的數必定有一對應差值，我們將其記憶下來，一旦出現對應差值時則必有解，唯獨解不是差值而是相對應的 index，所以必須要有 mapping 的表


5. walk through
```
when visit a index 
if I know the element of index is a some diff number
then the result is the mapping index and current index
else I memerize the diff n and mapping its index.
```

map d

1. If no sum is T, then?
2. Example
[1,2,3], 4 -> [0,2]
[...,-1, 2, 5, 6...], 4 -> [0,2]
[1...9999], 4
[1,2,9999], 4
[1,1,2,2], 4
[], 0
[1,3,2,2], 4

3. Brute
    - 每個東西兩兩相加，如果是 target 就得到答案。

3. Complexity
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(1)
 
5. Walk Through
